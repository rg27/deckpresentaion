## About Me

Rey is a web developer, currently living in Cebu City, Cebu, Philippines. He has a degree in Computer Engineering, with a focus in networking.

Rey learned hardware troubleshooting and configuration in his internship at Cebu SmartBuild, an IT company in Cebu which specializes in networking products,
computer accessories, FDAs, electrical wiring, installation and other technical process or solutions involving technology. After Cebu SmartBuild, he got his first shot
in web development as web developer intern for almost 3 months where he got a chance to work on Ruby-on-Rails and Ember.js, a web framework, and used bitbucket and github as a 
requirement for version control. On February 2020, Rey was hired by Office Partners 360 as a fulltime web developer and part of the admin team.
OP360 gives Rey an opportunity to explore, learn and integrate different technologies from Low Code platform to web frameworks. 

Rey is both driven, self-motivated, and strive to better herself as a developer by experimenting with new technologies and techniques 
especially in web development. When Rey is not glued in his laptop, he spends time biking and jogging.
